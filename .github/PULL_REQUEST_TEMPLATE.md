# “This PR…”

Having a simple, one sentence summary of the ticket ensures the PR has a clear overall focus. For example, “This PR...

    adds an email validator to the login screen”
    fixes a bug caused by an invalid string reference”
    disables the no longer supported Fabric integration”

# “Considerations and implementations”

This is the main body of the PR, and varies massively by PR. A simple PR may have a single sentence here, others may have multiple paragraphs, diagrams, etc.

# “How to test”

Having an ordered, straightforward list of steps to test the changes massively helps overall understanding. This list can also be used as hints for QA, and is a good place to upload any custom configuration files etc needed.

# Optional
## “Unit-Test(s) added”

Having this section helps reminds developers to always add tests, or explain themselves if they can’t!

## “Screenshots”

Having this section makes visual changes immediately obvious, and means visual bugs can often be identified instantly. Also, the screenshots are useful for non-devs preparing content for sprint review, or signing off work.

It’s worth mentioning that in less visual projects, this section could be called “Changes” and contain logs / process flows / etc. This section sometimes contains screenshots of Charles network requests or LogCat messages as well as normal screenshots.
