<a name="2.0.0"></a>
## [2.0.0] - 2022-05-08
### Breaking Changes
- X/Y coordinates can be given as input parameters (e.g. for testing!) & refactoring of GUI & CLI processing ([#99](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/issues/99)) [`dabe117`](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/commit/dabe1171ddd543cada6fbf372a8a342cad720716)

### BREAKING CHANGE

The GUI and CLI of wahooMapsCreator will now be called differently than
before:
- `python wahoomc gui` and
- `python wahoomc cli -co malta`

Für CLI and GUI, the default is now to calculate border countries.
The CLI option `-bc` was therefore replaced by `-nbc`, "do not calculate border countries".

Anaconda .yml files have now a different name for creating new environments. Existing Anaconda environments can still be used without adjustments!

The GUI and CLI of wahooMapsCreator will now be called differently than
before:
- `python wahoo_map_creator.py gui` and
- `python wahoo_map_creator.py cli -co malta`

This will ensure better control over the CLI input parameters, help
messages and is more consistent now!

<a name="1.0.0"></a>

### BREAKING CHANGE

The recommendation for the initial setup is now to create a virtual Python environment via Anaconda on Windows, macOS or Linux. Installing multiple programs manually with all setup details and problems now belongs to the past.

wahooMapsCreator can now be used much quicker and easier!

## [0.9.0] - 2021-10-19
### Added
- have more different tag-wahoo-xml files and move them to folders. Modify tag-wahoo.xml to differently display some "place"-tags [PR34](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/issues/34)
- tag-wahoo-v12.xml which is a updated version of the current tag-wahoo-hidrive2.xml. Bus_guideways have been removed and the zoom-appear levels are copied from the original wahoo maps. This really should replace tag-wahoo.xml eventually when v12 maps are created. [PR38](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/38)
- Howto doc for manually adding routing tiles [PR32](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/32)
### Changed
- move "central" download functions from downloader to file_directory_functions
- move files from common_resources into two new folders: common_download & common_python and into tooling [PR33](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/33)
- format python files in directory common_python using "autopep8" [PR35](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/35) [PR37](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/37)
- Replaced the publicly available osmconvert.exe (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) 0.8.8 with a special newer version 0.8.10. This version does NOT include the zlib library which enables processing of .osm.pbf files larger then 4GB on windows. The old version did have zlib which prevented processing of > 4Gb .osm.pbf files on windows. [PR38](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/pull/38)
### Fixed
